# static-files
Backup of static files for stickers and other resources.

All this stuff used to live in the Pickleback respository but has been moved out to cleanup the repository as we are no longer serving most of these static files through the PB server and instead are serving stickers, etc through Cloudfront with the bubonic bucket in S3 as the origin.
